    <h1>Peltier Filament Dry Box</h1>
<div class="box1">
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        Keeping filament dry is important as it determines print quality and whether certain types of filament can be successfully printed at all.
        However, with the extremely high humidity in Singapore, this is often not possible without going through many bottles of desicant. This is wasteful and 
        expensive. Therefore, I decided that it would be interesting to try and build my own filament dry box. This page will document the design, fabrication, 
        assembly, testing and my thoughts about this filament dry box.
        
    </p>
    
    <br>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">CAD</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        The first thing on my list was to model the parts that constitute the peltier assembly in Fusion 360. This helps me visualise how the assembly would 
        look like when attached to the box I had bought to store the filament. Next, I decided to design the system to collect the water that condenses on the 
        cold heatsink. This system would consist of a funnel to collect and direction water to a tray which is the 2nd component. Finally, we need a frame to
        mount the tray to the box. For the funnel, I made use of the loft tool narrow the opening and made sure to keep the walls at 45 degrees maximum so I could
        print the funnel without supports. The tray and frame were simple to design but I also made sure to be mindful of the angles so they could be printed without 
        supports too.

        <br><br>

        Next, I had to design an enclosure for the power supply due to the high input voltage of 240V. I designed the box to have a flip up cover so accessing the 
        power supply is convenient yet never swings open unintentionally as gracity holds it closed. Also the enclosure was designed to allow air to cool the power
        supply. Mesh inserts were designed to allow air to flow through the enclosure yet prevent users from accidently sticking their hand into the enclosure.

        Lastly, I designed rather hurriedly a electronics box to house the Arduino Nano, breadboard and circuit board.
        
    </p>

    <br>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Fabrication</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
       The water collection system was entirely 3D printed in PLA as well as the electronics box. The power supply enclosure was laser cut and engraved on the Epilog
       Fusion M2 while the mesh inserts were 3D printed. The fans and peltier module circuits were soldered onto a piece of veroboard. The Veroboard had been cut
       to size and drilled to accept screws. The copper strips were also sectioned so that the circuits won't short to each other while a common ground and Vcc 
       were kept with 2 rails each to handle the current. Some electronic components included N-channel MOSFET and BJTs for switching. 
        
    </p>

    <br>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Assembly</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
       The box was drilled, sawed and filed extensively to be able to fit the peltier assembly and wiring. In addition, holes were drilled for zipties which held 
       many of the components to the box. The peltier components were screwed together to ensure that the heatsinks were infull contact with the peltier
       and the thermal paste was applied to the peltier module surfaces and heatsink surfaces to improve thermal transfer. The power supply enclosure was assembled with a bit of
       wood glue and the cover was ziptied to the frame. The power supply came with 3 holes at the back 2 of which were tapped so it was convenient for me to bolt
       it to the enclosure which itself was bolted to the box. The veroboard was srewed to the electronics box, the breadboard was friction fit inside the box while
       the Adruino Uno was ziptied to the box. I had meant to use an Adruino Nano however it wasn't working so I had to use an Uno which did not fit it the box. 
       Therefore, the wiring is rather messy and exposed. The wiring was done according to a circuit diagram I had drawn previously. Soldering took place over many days as I had
       not had much experience soldering before. Being generous with flux was quite important as well as using a digital multimeter to check the connections.

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Testing and Programming</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      Testing here refers mostly to electronics while for hardware it was just testing if everything was dimensionally accurate and fit together with other parts.
      Electronics testing came in 2 phases, the prototype on using a breard board and temporary power supply and finally the actual circuit of the veroboard with
      the actual power supply. For the prototype I had to learn how to programme and test each individual component such as the lcd. Then slowly, I combined
      the components and my code and tested to make sure everything worked together. This testing included checking the fans, peliter module, lcd screen,
      dht11 humidity sensor and neopixel leds. Learning how to write functions in the IDE was very useful as it made the programme much neater and organised. 
      The programme was organised into the main loop and then functions for measuring and displaying the humidity and temperature, functions for the neopixels,
      fuctions for the fans and peltier module. During testing I realised tha the MOSFET I planned to use got extremely hot and I bought a replace instead.
      Finally, after the circuit was soldered and programme complete, I could test the actual cicuit. I had to remove a resistor and resolder some joints after 
      testing the circuit. Testing made sure that everything was working correctly and tuning the peltier pwm value so that it would be cold enough without
      the hot side getting too hot.

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
       I learnt a lot from the project in terms of electronics and programming. I had only learnt about free-wheeling diodes and mosfets in electronics modules
       in school but this projects allowed me to work with them in real life. I also wasn't familiar with designing circuits so this module helped me explore that
       and gave me the opportunity the work with ac voltage. Lastly, learning more of Arduino IDE syntax was valuable as I would definitely apply what I learnt
       like how to use functions and programming lcds and neopixels will be useful in future projects of mine. I really liked that I was able to build and design
       what I wanted in school and that allowed learning new things to be way more enjoyable.
