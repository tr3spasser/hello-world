       For this module, our CAD software of choice is Autodesk Fusion 360.
       It has a simple UI and it is easy to use.

        <p style="text-align: center;">
        
            Fusion 360 is a parametric CAD software meaning designs are created using constraints and dimensions.
            This allows you to change a single constraint or dimension and the entire design will change accordingly.
            While, non-parametric software might require you do re-design the part completely in order to change a single feature.
            <br><br>

            To create a 3D object in Fusion 360, we start from a sketch. 2D sketches are like drawing on a piece of paper.
            Then, we can use functions like extrude, revolve, loft, etc. to give the sketch volume. Our design is now a 3D object.

        <br>   <h2 style="text-align: center;">Designing for laser cutting</h2>    <br>

        <p style="text-align: center;">
            In week 5 of this semester, we were introduced to laser cutting. 
            We learnt how to design a simple box.
            The wooden panels are designed to be friction fit with tabs (finger-jointed). <br><br>
            In Fusion 360, being able to project existing geometries makes designing tabbed panels a whole lot easier.
            This is because projecting existing tabs of an adjacent piece means that you have the positions of the existing tabs and there is no need to measure and redraw those tabs on a new sketch.
            <br>
            Defining user parameters also makes modelling tabs much easier as you don't have to remember the dimensions of different tab sizes.
            Simply just enter the name of the user parameter to dimension the tab.
