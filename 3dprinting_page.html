    <h1>Fused Deposition Modelling aka 3D Printing</h1>
<div class="box1">
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        3D printing works by layering molten plastic on top of each other to form a 3D object. Imagine 
        cutting paper into smaller and smaller circles each time. When you stack the paper in decending
        order, you get a cone. 3D printing is exactly like that except those paper sheets are replaced 
        with layers of plastic.
        
    </p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Slicers</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        Slicers are computer software that convert 3D models into gcode which the 3d printer can read.
        Slicers literally slice the 3d model into layers of a certain thickness that is specified by the user
        and gives the printer instructions on what to do for each layer.
        Slicers these days are extremely powerful and allow the users to tune their printers to their liking.
        One can even include text on their 3D models in the slicers itself.

        <br> <br>

        The slicer introduced to us in this module was Cura. However, I have been using PrusaSlicer for 
        quite a while so I preferred PrusaSlicer.

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Printer and Filament</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
       The printers available in school were the Ender 3 V2. However, I used my own printer which is
       the Ender 3 Neo. It is an i3 style printer with a bowden extruder and a PTFE lined heatbreak.
       I used Polylactic Acid (PLA) filament for all my prints.
