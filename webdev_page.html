    <h1>Website Developement</h1>
<div class="box1">
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        These days most people use website builders to create their websites as have I. However, during the module, we were introduced to html, css and javascript.
        I figured it would be interesting to try writing the website programmes myself. Therefore, I used Visual Studio Code to programme the website.

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Programming</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        I took me a while to understand the basic syntax of html and css. Following cheatsheets and examples online, I was able to create lists and 
        write text in different sizes. With CSS, I learnt how to create boxes for text, change the colours of objects and insert pictures.

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Github</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      Creating a github account was simple. However, getting my head around how Github works is difficult. Also I was confused about how to link different files to each other.
      For example, if I have files in folders what path should I put to call that file if my other file is in a different folder. I also kept making the mistake of 
      updating many files in quick sucession and have some of the uploads fail. However, I think Github is really useful for collaboration and storing 
      project files on. I do want to continue using it in the future.
